# Step 1: Initialize AI with Master Guide

<div class="mt-8">

## The Workflow Starts Here

```bash
# In your AI assistant (Claude or Gemini)
Read docs/PromptTemplates/00-MASTER-GUIDE.md
```

### What This Does

The Master Guide teaches your AI assistant:
- ✅ The PRD → SPEC → Guardrails → AC pipeline
- ✅ The Organism → Molecule → Atom hierarchy
- ✅ The three-phase workflow (Foundation → Implementation → Milestones)
- ✅ What resources are available (DevContainer, .env, Tech Notes)

</div>

<div class="mt-8 p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg">

### 💡 Pro Tip
You only need to load the Master Guide **once per session**. It sets the context for everything that follows.
