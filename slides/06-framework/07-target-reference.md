<!--
INSTRUCTOR TIP: Tell students to open this slide in a second browser tab.
Reference it when they ask "How should the map look?" or "Is my transit data working?"

This screenshot shows the FULLY WORKING app with:
- All acceptance criteria met
- All features implemented
- Multi-language functional (Spanish shown)
- Transit markers visible
- Events sidebar complete

If their app doesn't look like this, something's missing.
If it DOES look like this, they're done!
