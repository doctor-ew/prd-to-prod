## The Problems It Solves

### 🎯 Feature Drift

### 🧠 Context Loss
After 20 prompts, AI forgets the original goal

### 🔧 Unmaintainable Code
"It works but I don't know why"

### 🚫 No Database Syndrome
Missing fundamental architecture

<div>

## The Benefits You Get

### ✅ Clear Boundaries
Every component has a defined purpose

### ✅ Reusable Patterns
8 frameworks = 8 reusable approaches

### ✅ Team Alignment
Specs are documentation

### ✅ Production-Ready
Not "maybe works" but "definitely works"
