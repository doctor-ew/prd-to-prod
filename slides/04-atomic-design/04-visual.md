# Visual: Atomic Hierarchy

<div class="mt-8">

## Why This Works

### Prevents Context Loss
Each Atom is small enough for AI to understand completely

### Enables Parallelization
Molecules can be worked on independently

### Documents Architecture
The hierarchy IS your documentation

### Facilitates Testing
Each Atom has clear acceptance criteria
