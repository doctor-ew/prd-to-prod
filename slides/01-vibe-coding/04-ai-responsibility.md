<!--
This is a critical reminder slide before hands-on work begins.

Key message: AI is a powerful tool, but YOU are accountable.

The balance image represents:
- AI (tool/assistant) on one side
- Human judgment (brain/responsibility) on the other
- The developer must maintain the balance

This slide should make attendees pause and reflect before they start
generating code with AI assistants. It sets proper expectations about
their role and accountability in the AI-assisted development process.
